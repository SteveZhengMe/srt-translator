00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,791
Here! Over here!

3
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,875
And there was a time
when the world was so young,

4
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,916
there had not yet been a sunrise.

5
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:41,375
But even then there was light.

6
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,875
Well, is it finished yet?

7
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:21,375
Even you couldn't possibly believe
that old scrap will float.

8
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,333
It's not going to float.

9
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,666
It's going to sail.

10
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:49,750
-Stop!

11
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,166
No, don't!

12
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,041
-Stop, you'll break it!

13
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,083
Stop! Don't!

14
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,500
-Come on.
-Stop, you're breaking it! Stop!

15
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,000
I told you it wouldn't float.

16
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,166
Get off me!

17
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,541
Lose your footing again, Galadriel?

18
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,833
It was a good ship, sister.

19
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,833
I made it just as you taught me.

20
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:30,291
Do you know why a ship floats
and a stone cannot?

21
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:35,333
Because the stone sees only downward.

22
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:40,250
The darkness of the water is vast
and irresistible.

23
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,750
The ship feels the darkness as well,

24
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,666
striving moment by moment
to master her and pull her under.

25
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,750
But the ship has a secret.

26
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:57,291
For unlike the stone,
her gaze is not downward but up.

27
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,875
Fixed upon the light that guides her,

28
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,833
whispering of grander things
than darkness ever knew.

29
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,500
But sometimes the lights shine
just as brightly

30
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,250
reflected in the water
as they do in the sky.

31
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,541
It's hard to say which way is up
and which way is down.

32
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,875
How am I to know which lights to follow?

33
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,875
But that seems so simple.

34
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,166
The most important truths often are.

35
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,458
But you must learn
to discern them for yourself.

36
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,375
I won't always be here
to speak them to you.

37
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,875
You won't?

38
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,750
Come along. Mother and Father are waiting.

39
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,458
We had no word for death.

40
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,541
For we thought our joys would be unending.

41
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,833
We thought our light would never dim.

42
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,791
So when the Great Foe, Morgoth,

43
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,916
destroyed the very light of our home...

44
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,791
We resisted.

45
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:47,250
And a legion of Elves went to war.

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,958
We left Valinor, our home,
and journeyed to a distant realm.

47
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,250
One filled with untold perils
and strange creatures beyond count.

48
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,375
A place known as Middle-earth.

49
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,875
Valaron kalanen!

50
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:40,333
FiruvantÃ«!

51
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,500
They said it would be over quickly,

52
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:52,458
but the war left Middle-earth in ruin.

53
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:59,250
And would last centuries.

54
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,666
Now, we learned many words for death.

55
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,875
In the end, Morgoth would be defeated.

56
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,625
But not before much sorrow.

57
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:42,750
For his Orcs had spread
to every corner of Middle-earth,

58
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,583
Multiplying ever greater

59
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,166
under the command
of his most devoted servant,

60
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,083
a cruel and cunning sorcerer.

61
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,000
They called him Sauron.

62
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,291
My brother vowed to seek him out
and destroy him.

63
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,208
But Sauron found him first

64
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,625
and marked his flesh with a symbol.

65
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,875
One whose meaning even our wisest
could not discern.

66
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,208
And there, in the darkness,

67
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,041
his vow became mine.

68
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,625
And so, we hunted.

69
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,750
To the ends of the Earth we hunted Sauron.

70
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,833
But the trail grew thin.

71
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,208
Year gave way to year.

72
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,166
Century gave way to century.

73
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:55,375
And for many Elves, the pain of those days

74
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,458
passed out of thought and mind.

75
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,000
More and more of our kind

76
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,583
began to believe that Sauron
was but a memory.

77
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,750
And the threat, at last, was ended.

78
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,916
I wish I could be one of them.

79
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,833
Commander Galadriel.

80
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:20,000
This company has followed you
to the very edge of the world.

81
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,875
But none who ever dared search
for this last stronghold

82
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,375
has ever found anything.

83
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,916
It's been years
since the last Orc was sighted.

84
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,250
Is it not possible the other commanders
are right and our enemy is no more?

85
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,541
Night is closing in.

86
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:40,291
How long can living flesh endure
where even sunlight fears to tread?

87
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,250
Perhaps we would be wise to camp here.

88
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,250
And tomorrow, begin the journey home.

89
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,166
We are losing the light.

90
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,291
Commander, wait!

91
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,875
No. We keep moving.

92
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,791
Galadriel, stop!

93
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,416
There's nothing out here.
We should have been there by now.

94
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,875
We are there.

95
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,750
This is it.

96
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,041
This is where the Orcs gathered
after Morgoth's defeat.

97
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,041
Far more must have escaped,
than we ever imagined.

98
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,416
My hand is past feeling.

99
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,541
No.

100
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,500
This place is so evil,
our torches give off no warmth.

101
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,416
This way.

102
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,500
How can you be certain?

103
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,666
It's colder than the rest.

104
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,875
A door was filled in here.

105
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,083
Bring it down.

106
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,625
What devilry is this?

107
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,916
These Orcs were meddling
with the powers of the Unseen World.

108
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,583
Some dark sorcery of old.

109
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,458
But what was their purpose?

110
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,250
Surely, it is lost to the ages now.

111
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,500
Whatever happened here was long ago.

112
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,208
Water.

113
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,291
Even stone cannot hide the mark

114
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,958
of one whose very hand
is flame unquenched.

115
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:43,791
He was here.

116
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,666
Sauron was here.

117
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,458
Tell the others to rest while they can.

118
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,750
At sunrise we move on.
We'll take the search further north.

119
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,916
Further north?

120
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,916
This mark was left as a trail
for Orcs to follow.

121
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,333
The last time I saw it was on my brother.

122
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,041
We must follow it.

123
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,583
The mark is centuries old.

124
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,500
Whoever left it could be long dead.

125
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,458
Or lying in wait, gathering strength,

126
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,875
perfecting whatever dark art
eluded him here.

127
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,958
We exceeded our orders months ago.

128
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:17,083
Surely we must first return home
to take counsel with the High King.

129
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,666
I promise you there is not a soul
amongst our company

130
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,708
who yearns for home more than I.

131
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,791
I can still feel the light of the Trees
on my face.

132
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,208
I can still see it.

133
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,375
And until we are certain

134
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,458
every trace of our enemy is vanquished...

135
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,458
I can never return.

136
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,375
Snow-troll!

137
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,375
We should never
have come in here.

138
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,833
We leave soon enough.

139
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,833
The order is given.

140
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,458
We march at first light.

141
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,500
Then you shall do so alone.

142
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,875
Something's wrong here.
Nothing to hunt.

143
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,791
Wolves in every thicket.

144
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,541
Don't you think
it's the least bit strange?

145
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,375
World's strange.

146
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,416
If I let 'em pitch-kettle me,

147
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,791
I'd never get off me barstool.

148
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,625
-Oi, oi!

149
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,833
Keep walkin'.

150
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,000
Why?

151
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,333
Looked like a badger. Maybe a fox.

152
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,750
More likely a Harfoot.

153
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,083
A Harfoot?

154
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,000
Ugh. Don't care to be seein' none,

155
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,125
but if you do, watch yourself.

156
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,541
Dangerous creatures they are.

157
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:32,958
You're making it up.

158
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,375
Come on. Rattle your dags!

159
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,250
Let's just get to the lake before sundown.

160
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,541
-Huh? Huh.

161
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,208
Clear and clear.

162
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,250
Nori!

163
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,375
Nori!

164
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,666
Nori!

165
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,333
Nori!

166
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,416
Travelers? At this time of year?

167
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,791
-It's an omen, I warrant ya.

168
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,458
-Mmm-hmm. Bad one. As bad as they come.
-Easy, Malva.

169
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,791
The last time we had travelers this early,
it was the Great Frost.

170
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,250
And there's no misremembering
how bleak a season that was.

171
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,333
More than likely they just got lost,
that's it.

172
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,833
Has to be the reason.

173
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,250
You're gonna spoil dinner.

174
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,208
I've looked high and low again.

175
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,958
The wee ones are still out there.

176
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,583
They'll be fine, Goldie.

177
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,375
Nori's with them. You know Nori.
